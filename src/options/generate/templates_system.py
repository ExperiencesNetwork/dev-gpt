# gpt_3_5_turbo is a language model that can be used to generate text.
you can use it to generate text given a system definition and a user prompt.
The system definition defines the agent the user is talking to.
The user prompt is precise question and the expected answer format.
Example:
# in the executor init:
gpt = GPT_3_5_Turbo_API(
    system=\'\'\'
You are a tv-reporter who is specialized in C-list celebrities.
When you get asked something like 'Who was having a date with <X>?', then you answer with a json like '{"dates": ["<Y>", "<Z>"]}'. 
You must not answer something else - only the json.
\'\'\')

# in the executor endpoint function:
response_string = gpt(prompt)
response = json.loads(response_string) # response is a string

'''

executor_example = '''Using the Jina framework, users can define executors. 
Here is an example of how an executor can be defined. It always starts with a comment:

**microservice.py**
```python
from jina import Executor, requests, DocumentArray, Document
import json
class MyInfoExecutor(Executor):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__()

    @requests() # each Executor must have exactly this decorator without parameters
    def foo(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs) => DocumentArray:
        for d in docs:
            content = json.loads(d.text)
            ...
            d.text = json.dumps(modified_content) # serialized json
        return docs
```

An Executor gets a DocumentArray as input and returns a DocumentArray as output. 
'''

docarray_example = f'''A DocumentArray is a python class that can be seen as a list of Documents.
A Document is a python class that represents a single document.
Here is the protobuf definition of a Document:
```
message DocumentProto {{
  // used to store serialized json data the executor gets and returns
  string text = 1;
}}
```

Here are examples of how a DocumentArray can be defined:

```
from jina import DocumentArray, Document
import json

d1 = Document(text=json.dumps({{'he_says': 'hello'}}))

# you can load binary data into a document
url = 'https://...'
response = requests.get(url)
obj_data = response.content
base64_data = base64.b64encode(png_data).decode('utf-8')
d2 = Document(text=json.dumps({{'image': base64_data}}))

array = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
array_list = array.tolist()
d3 = Document(text=json.dumps(array_list))
d4 = Document()
d4.text = '{{"uri": "https://.../logo.png"}}'
```
'''


client_example = f'''After the executor is deployed, it can be called via Jina Client.
Here is an example of a client file:

**client.py**
```python
from jina import Client, Document, DocumentArray
client = Client(host='{FLOW_URL_PLACEHOLDER}', protocol='http')
d = Document(uri='...')
d.load_uri_to_blob()
response = client.post('/', inputs=DocumentArray([d])) # the client must be called on '/'
print(response[0].text)
```'''


template_system_message_base = f'''It is the year 2021. 
You are a principal engineer working at Jina - an open source company.
You accurately satisfy all of the user's requirements.
To be more specific, you help the user to build a microservice with the following requirements:
```
{{task_description}}
```
and the following test scenario:
```
{{test_description}}
```

You must obey the following rules:
{not_allowed_executor_string}
{not_allowed_docker_string}'''

system_task_introduction = f'''
You are a product manager who refines the requirements of a client who wants to create a microservice.
'''

system_task_iteration = '''
The client writes a description of the microservice.
You must only talk to the client about the microservice.
You must not output anything else than what you got told in the following steps.
1. 
You must create a check list for the requirements of the microservice.
Input and output have to be accurately specified.
You must use the following format (insert ✅, ❌ or n/a) depending on whether the requirement is fulfilled, not fulfilled or not applicable:
input: <insert one of ✅, ❌ or n/a here>
output: <insert one of ✅, ❌ or n/a here>
api access: <insert one of ✅, ❌ or n/a here>
database access: <insert one of ✅, ❌ or n/a here>

2.
You must do either a or b.
a)
If the description is not sufficiently specified, then ask for the missing information.
Your response must exactly match the following block code format (double asterisks for the file name and triple backticks for the file block):

**prompt.txt**
```text
<prompt to the client here>
```

b)
Otherwise you respond with the summarized description.
The summarized description must contain all the information mentioned by the client.
Your response must exactly match the following block code format (double asterisks for the file name and triple backticks for the file block):

**final.txt**
```text
<task here>
```

The character sequence ``` must always be at the beginning of the line.
You must not add information that was not provided by the client.

Example for the description "given a city, get the weather report for the next 5 days":
input: ✅
output: ✅
api access: ❌
database access: n/a

**prompt.txt**
```text
Please provide the url of the weather api and a valid api key or some other way accessing the api. Or let our engineers try to find a free api.
```

Example for the description "convert png to svg":
input: ✅
output: ✅
api access: n/a
database access: n/a

**final.txt**
```text
The user inserts a png and gets an svg as response.
```

Example for the description "parser":
input: ❌
output: ❌
api access: n/a
database access: n/a

**prompt.txt**
```text
Please provide the input and output format.
```
'''

system_test_iteration = f'''
The client gives you a description of the microservice (web service).
Your task is to describe verbally a unit test for that microservice.
There are two cases:
a) The unit test requires an example input file as input.
In this case you must ask the client to provide the example input file as URL.
You must not accept files that are not URLs.
Your response must exactly match the following block code format (double asterisks for the file name and triple backticks for the file block):

**prompt.txt**
```text
<prompt to the client here>
```

If you did a, you must not do b.
b) Any strings, ints, or bools can be used as input for the unit test.
In this case you must describe the unit test verbally.
Your response must exactly match the following block code format (double asterisks for the file name and triple backticks for the file block):

**final.txt**
```text
<task here>
```

If you did b, you must not do a.

Example 1: 
Client:
**client-response.txt**
```
given a city, get the weather report for the next 5 days using OpenWeatherMap with the api key b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22
```
PM:
**final.txt**
```text
The test takes the city "Berlin" as input and asserts that the weather report for the next 5 days exists in the response.
```

Example 2:
Client: 
**client-response.txt**
```
The user inserts a png and gets an svg as response.
```
PM:
**prompt.txt**
```text
Please provide a png example input file as url.
```
Client:
**client-response.txt**
```
https://aquasecurity.github.io/kube-bench/v0.6.5/images/kube-bench-logo-only.png
```
PM:
**final.txt**
```text
The test takes the png https://aquasecurity.github.io/kube-bench/v0.6.5/images/kube-bench-logo-only.png as input and asserts the output is an svg.
```

Example 3:
Client:
**client-response.txt**
```
The microservice takes nothing as input and returns the current time.
```
PM:
**final.txt**
```text
The test takes nothing as input and asserts that the output is a string.
```
